[Azure OpenAI Conversation Custom Integration](https://github.com/joselcaguilar/azure-openai-ha) for Home Assistant
</h3>

# What This Is

This custom integration adds a conversation agent powered by [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/cognitive-services/openai-service) in Home Assistant, it's based on the original [OpenAI Conversation integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/openai_conversation/) for Home Assistant.

# What It Does

This is equivalent to the built-in [OpenAI Conversation integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/openai_conversation/). The difference is that it uses the OpenAI algorithms available through Azure. Other than that the goal is to keep the differences to a minimum. You can use this conversation integration with Assistants in Home Assistant to control you house. They have all the capabilities the built-in OpenAI Conversation integration has.

# Limitations

- **Home Assistant versions** required: 2023.5+

# Installation and Configuration
1. Download and install the integration from HACS: [Azure OpenAI Conversation](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=joselcaguilar&repository=azure-openai-ha&category=integration).
2. Restart your Home Assistant instance
3. Go to [Settings -> Devices & Services -> Add Integration -> Azure OpenAI Conversation](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=azure_openai_conversation)
4.  To have a conversation, made sure to deploy a chat completion model (like gpt-35-turbo or gpt-4o) in Azure. 
5. If you want to generate images using the available `generate_image` service, make sure to deploy the `dall-e-3` model as well.
5. Type your `API Key`, `API Base` and `API Version` used following the example below and hit submit:
> - API Key: 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef <br>
> - API Base: https://iotlabopenai.openai.azure.com/ <br>
> - API Version: 2023-03-15-preview <br>
6. Configure your assistant to use the Azure OpenAI Conversation.

#  Options

Options for Azure OpenAI Conversation can be set via the user interface, by taking the following steps:

1. Browse to your Home Assistant instance.
2. In the sidebar click on [Settings -> Devices & Services](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integrations/).
3. FInd the Azure Open AI Conversation integration and click 'Options'

Options available (same as built-in OpenAI conversation):
- **Prompt:**
The starting text for the AI language model to generate new text from. This text can include information about your Home Assistant instance, devices, and areas and is written using [Home Assistant Templating](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/templating).

- **Model:** The name of the GPT language model deployed for text generation (i.e.- `my-gpt35-model`). You can find more details on the available models in the [Azure OpenAI Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models#finding-what-models-are-available). If you are having issues using an assistant that uses this integration please check this model is the model you actually deployed.

- Maximum Tokens to Return in Response
The maximum number of words or "tokens" that the AI model should generate in its completion of the prompt. For more information, see the [Azure OpenAI Completion Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview#tokens).

- **Temperature:** A value that determines the level of creativity and risk-taking the model should use when generating text. A higher temperature means the model is more likely to generate unexpected results, while a lower temperature results in more deterministic results. See the [Azure OpenAI Completion Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/openai/how-to/completions) for more information.

- **Top P:** An alternative to temperature, top_p determines the proportion of the most likely word choices the model should consider when generating text. A higher top_p means the model will only consider the most likely words, while a lower top_p means a wider range of words, including less likely ones, will be considered. For more information, see the [Azure OpenAI Completion Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/openai/how-to/completions).

# Changelog

Please reference the [release history](https://github.com/joselcaguilar/azure-openai-ha/releases).

# How to Help

While it'd be nice to have more developers, you can contribute without knowing how to code. You can [file bugs/feature requests](https://github.com/joselcaguilar/azure-openai-ha/issues), or you can help with other tasks like [UI Translations](#ui-translations) and updating the [README](./README.md).

## UI Translations

More languages can be added [here](./custom_components/azure_openai_conversation/translations), contributions are welcome :)

Languages available:
- English

## Documentation

The [README](./README.md) file will be used for Documentation, if it's expanded in the future with automations or other tweaks, we can think on a wiki for that purpose.

> **Disclaimer:** Don't worry about making mistakes as we can revert using the history ðŸ˜Š.
